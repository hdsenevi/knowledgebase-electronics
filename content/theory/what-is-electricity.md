# What is electricity?

- All matter is made of Atoms

- All Atoms are made of:
  - Neutrols - Neutral Charge
    - Reside in the core of an Atom
  - Protons - Positive Charge
    - Reside in the core of an Atom
  - Electrons - Negative Charge
    - Orbits ourside core of an Atom
- Normally Atoms have a nuetral charge. It has the same amount of electrons and protons
- Electrons can be easity moved from or to the electron orbitals of an atom
  - Either by loosing or gaining electrons
  - There by either becoming positively or negatively charged
- Electronic circutes have electrons moving in multitudes of ways
  - The study of electronics concerns itself with directing these electrons to achive desired effects with electronic components
- Analogy
  - Electronic designer : coach
  - Component : playing field
  - Electrons : players
