# History

### Electricity found in nature

- Spectacular displays : Lightning
- Subtle display : nervous system
  - Transfering information by electricity

### Formal research

- 18th century
- Benjamin Franklin - 1752
- Famous kite experiment
- First to identify + and - charges

### Modern commercial age

- Invention of transistor 1947

# Terminology

## Volt

Unit of meaturement for electrical potential

`"Volt" - Electrical potential = Voltage`

- Alessandro Volta 1800
- Invented "voltaic pile" aka battery

## Amp or Ampere

Unit of measurement for electric current

- Andre-Marie Ampere 1820
- Eletro magnetism
- Foundational for motors and generators

## Ohm

Unit of measurement for electrical resistance

- Important mathemaricsl relationships
- Ohm's Law
- Voltage, current & resistance

## Joules law a.k.k Power law

Mathematical equation for "Power"

Unit of meature for **power** is **Watt**
$$
P = I x V
$$


- James Prescott Joule 1840
- James Watt of steam engine renown

# Foundational Elements for Study

| Measurement | Description                                                  |
